# Structure Beats Magic — site style, voice & SEO guide

The single reference for how this site is written, designed, structured and found.
Read this before editing copy, adding a section, or dropping in a new infographic.
Sister enterprise site (`jacovanderlaan.com`) shares the palette and much of the
voice — keep them visually and tonally consistent.

---

## 1. Brand & positioning (what the site is)

- **Master brand:** *Structure Beats Magic* — the umbrella thesis. Knowledge
  Management, re-architected for the AI era.
- **One-line thesis:** "The magic isn't in the model. It's in the structure you
  give it."
- **The formula (always this order):** `Structure + Data + AI + Rules + Skills → Systems`.
  Rules is the deliberate climax — "the missing word" everyone forgets. Skills is
  repeatable capability. Systems (in gold) is the payoff.
- **Brand architecture:** this hub gives the *what/why* free (the recipe) and
  routes the *how/method* to paid engagements at jacovanderlaan.com (the kitchen).
  "Give the recipe, sell the kitchen."
- **Two audiences, one formula:** route content by **audience, not domain** —
  knowledge-workers (B2C, the audience engine) and builders/teams/orgs (B2B, the
  cash lane). Personal proof feeds business credibility.
- **NOT "PKM".** We say *Knowledge Management re-architected for the AI era*. PKM
  is the consumer-grade MVP of what a disciplined vault already does.
- **Thesis, not framework.** Position as a thinker/practitioner with a point of
  view, never a product or a certifiable framework to sell.

## 2. Voice & tone (how it sounds)

- **First person, calm, declarative.** Jaco speaking — "I built…", "the work was…".
  Confident without hype. No exclamation marks, no emoji in body copy.
- **Plain over clever.** Short sentences. Concrete nouns. "Boring is what still
  works next year." Earn trust by being specific, not by selling.
- **Show proof, not slides.** Always ground claims in the real numbers
  (155,000 photos, 271 books, a decade of trips) and real systems. "Proof, not
  slides." Never fabricate metrics, reviews, or testimonials — a personal thesis
  site dies on a fake "4.9/5 from 1,842 users".
- **The honest counterweight.** Every strong claim gets its caveat: structure
  beats magic *only when the structure is usable*; don't over-build; AI reduces
  the problem, doesn't remove it — still verify. Credibility comes from naming the
  limits.
- **Signature lines** (reuse, don't overuse): "Structure beats magic." · "Give
  the recipe, sell the kitchen." · "A toy vs an instrument." · "Rent the AI; own
  the structure." · "Notes organize. Architecture personalizes."
- **British-ish spelling** in body copy is fine (organise, visualise) — keep a
  given page internally consistent.
- **Em dashes** for asides — used freely, the house punctuation. Curly quotes.
- **AI-tell avoidance:** no "delve", "tapestry", "in today's fast-paced world",
  "unlock/unleash/supercharge", "game-changer", "elevate". No three-item rule-of-
  three padding. If a sentence sounds like a chatbot, cut it.

## 3. Layout & design rules (how it looks)

### Palette (CSS custom properties in `assets/site.css`)
| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | `#f7f8fa` | page background (off-white) |
| `--surface` | `#fff` | cards |
| `--ink` | `#0f172a` | primary text / deep navy |
| `--ink-soft` | `#475569` | secondary text, ledes |
| `--ink-faint` | `#94a3b8` | captions, meta |
| `--accent` | `#2563eb` | brand blue — links, CTAs, eyebrows |
| `--accent-dk` | `#1e40af` | hover |
| `--gold` | `#b88a1b` | the payoff / "Systems" / climax only — use sparingly |
| `--line` | `#e2e8f0` | borders |

- **Type:** Inter / system sans. Eyebrows are uppercase, letter-spaced, accent
  colour. Section titles large and tight (`letter-spacing:-.02em`).
- **Formula styling:** light bordered card (surface bg, navy text, `--line`
  border), gold arrow + gold "Systems" result. Same on desktop and mobile — it
  must NOT be a dark pill (reads as the nav bar on phones).
- **⚠️ Card grids — NO orphan/hanging card (publish check).** A row of cards must
  fill its rows evenly: **N cards → pick columns that divide N.** 6 cards → 3×2,
  4 cards → 2×2, 3 cards → 3×1. Do **not** use `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(...))`
  for a fixed known count — it packs e.g. 4-per-row and leaves a lone card
  dangling on the next row (the "3+1" / "4+2" gap). Pin `grid-template-columns:
  repeat(<divisor>, 1fr)` with responsive step-downs (e.g. 3→2→1). When you
  add or remove a card, re-check the column count still divides the total.

### Generating the infographics (ChatGPT)
Every infographic is generated in ChatGPT, **one concept per image** — never a dense
numbered multi-panel sheet. If an image comes back as a grid or with panel numbers,
it's wrong for this site — regenerate as a single concept, no numbering. The reusable
ChatGPT master prompt and the per-slot briefs are kept **private** (input, not
publication) in the vault, not in this repo:
`D:/vault/personal/career/2-active/positioning/2026-06-29_infographic-image-briefs-chatgpt.md`.

### Naming & catalog (VERPLICHT — geen UUID's)
Images komen uit ChatGPT met **UUID-namen** (`6678c568-….png`) — die zijn onvindbaar
en niet te documenteren. **Hernoem ELKE image meteen bij het plaatsen** naar:

**`<article-slug>-<rol>.png`** — rol = `hero` voor de openings-image, dan `01`, `02`, …
op leesvolgorde. Slug = artikel-bestandsnaam zonder `.html` (`index` → `home`).
Voorbeeld: `the-filter-youre-missing-anti-interests-hero.png`, `…-01.png`.

Workflow bij een nieuwe image:
1. **Genereren** (ChatGPT, één concept per image — zie hierboven).
2. **Hernoemen** naar de conventie VÓÓR je 'm in de HTML zet (nooit de UUID laten staan).
3. **Plaatsen** volgens de IMAGE RULE (één figure per tekstblok, niet stacken).
4. **Catalogiseren**: regel toevoegen aan `assets/IMAGE-CATALOG.md` (bestand + korte
   beschrijving van wat de infographic toont). Zo weet je later wat elke image is.
5. **Ongebruikte** naar `W:/…/images/sbm-unused/` (public repo = alleen gepubliceerde images).

⚠️ Als je UUID-named PNGs in `assets/` ziet = niet-gecatalogiseerd → hernoemen +
in de catalog zetten. Audit: `ls assets/*.png | grep -E '[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}'`
moet leeg zijn. (Bulk-rename van 20 legacy-UUID's gedaan 2026-07-01.)

### IMAGE RULE (important — frequently violated)
**Never stack two `<figure>` elements back-to-back without a substantial text
block (≈25+ words: a paragraph, card grid, or list) between them.** Two images
touching looks like a dump and kills rhythm.

- One figure per text block. Interleave figures *among* the prose, don't pile them
  at the end of a section.
- When new infographics arrive and a section would end up with 2+ stacked:
  **re-evaluate, keep the single best for that spot, and relocate the others** to
  sections where they're separated by text (or to another page entirely). Drop
  true duplicates rather than placing both.
- Prefer the most on-message image for each concept; move overlapping
  process/pipeline diagrams apart so they don't compete.
- Audit before committing (regex: consecutive `<figure>…</figure>` with <25 words
  of stripped text between them = a violation).

### Where specific content lives
- **Data-architecture / MDDE method visuals** (Kimball→stars, lineage, SCD2, the
  "Visual Guides" series) belong on **jacovanderlaan.com** (`mdde.html`), NOT on
  SBM — that's the enterprise method, the paid lane.
- **"Stop Prompting / Directing" infographic series** → the *Stop-Prompting-Start-
  Directing* article (a representative subset; don't dump all 36 panels).
- **Photo / knowledge-graph / modeled-self visuals** → SBM homepage
  (why-structure, next-level) and `/system`.

## 4. Structure & navigation (how it's organised)

- **Static-first (ADR-046):** plain HTML + shared `assets/site.css`. No framework,
  no runtime on the hub. The travel-curation sample site uses Astro separately.
- **Pages:** `/` (hub) · `/system/` (how it works) · `/intelligence/` (intelligence
  systems) · `/influences/` (references) · `/articles/*` (writing).
- **Nav = 5 compact dropdown groups** (Thesis · System · Proof · Writing ·
  enterprise CTA), hover on desktop, inline-expand on mobile (CSS-only hamburger,
  breakpoint `max-width:860px`). Don't exceed ~5 top-level items.
- **Section pattern:** `eyebrow → section-title → section-lede → content`. Long
  pages (`/system`) get a themed TOC at the top; keep TOC entries in sync with
  section IDs.
- **Markdown HARD rules (shared with the vault):** one blank line after
  frontmatter, never double blanks; no hard-wrapping mid-sentence (one line per
  paragraph) in `.md` drafts.

## 5. Writing → articles pipeline (folder-per-article, since 2026-07-04)

Each published article is a **folder** on `W:/systems/products/sbm/articles/`, named
by its slug (= the published HTML filename). Everything for one article lives together
— text, images, and private working files. See ADR-066 for the rationale and the
runbook `sbm-hub-site-publish.md` for the step-by-step.

```
W:/systems/products/sbm/articles/
  <slug>/
    <slug>.md          ← folder-note = the article source (frontmatter + body)
    assets/*.png       ← THIS article's images (hero + infographics)
    briefs.md          ← ChatGPT image-briefs for this article   (NOT published)
    notes.md           ← working notes                           (NOT published)
    actions.md         ← open actions                            (NOT published)
    comments.md        ← feedback / comments                     (NOT published)
  _drafts/             ← WIP pieces, still flat (not yet folderised)
  _migrated-flat-backup/  ← the pre-2026-07-04 flat sources (archive; safe to keep)
```

- **Source of truth = the folder-note markdown.** `build_articles.py` (in the repo)
  scans the article folders and renders styled HTML.
- **Assets are a BUILD OUTPUT.** The builder copies each `<slug>/assets/*` into the
  repo `assets/` at build time. Do **not** hand-place article images in the repo —
  put them in the article folder's `assets/` and rebuild. This structurally prevents
  the renamed-asset / stale-reference drift bug.
- **Allow-list:** only slugs listed in `ARTICLES` in `build_articles.py` publish.
- **Private-section convention (what publishes):** the folder-note is one markdown
  document. Everything publishes **except** a fixed set of trailing working sections:
  `## Notes`, `## Actions`, `## Comments`, `## Briefs`. The builder cuts the body at
  the first such heading — so you can keep a status summary at the bottom of the
  folder-note and it stays private. (The detailed working files are separate `.md`
  files in the folder; the sections are the at-a-glance summary.) Mirrors the vault's
  protected manual-sections rule.
- **Frontmatter (aligned with the MDDE article schema):**
  - *Rendered by the builder:* `title` (required), `subtitle`, `face`
    (`B2C…`/`B2B…` → audience eyebrow), `created`, optional `hero_image` +
    `hero_caption` (filename in the article's `assets/`).
  - *SBM routing (not rendered):* `brand`, `series`, `type`
    (`signature`/`reflection`/`announcement`), `companion_to` (a slug),
    `canonical_home`.
  - *Publication tracking (not rendered; same field names as MDDE so one tracker
    spans both):* `tags`, `categories`, `topic`, `slug`, `url` (the live
    structurebeatsmagic.com URL), and `medium` / `substack` / `wp_id` /
    `wp_status` / `last_synced_at` — `null` for now (SBM is GitHub Pages), ready
    to fill when an article is cross-posted or pushed to WordPress.
  - The builder ignores every field except the rendered set, so extra tracking
    fields never leak into the HTML.
- **Do NOT** repeat the subtitle as an italic lede in the body — the builder strips a
  leading `*italic*` lede, but just omit the duplicate.
- **Figure shortcode:** `[[figure: filename.png | caption]]` — filename is the image
  in this article's `assets/`. Subject to the no-stacked-figures image rule.
- Markdown subset: `#/##/###`, `**bold**` (may contain `*italic*`), `*italic*`,
  `[links](url)`, `---` rules, `-`/`*` bullet lists, figure shortcode, inline code
  `` `like this` ``, and fenced code blocks ```` ``` ```` (verbatim `<pre><code>`).
- Rebuild after edits: `python build_articles.py` (copies assets, writes
  `articles/*.html`, `_cards.html`, regenerates `sitemap.xml`).

## 6. SEO & metadata

- **Per page:** unique `<title>` (`Page — Structure Beats Magic`), `<meta
  name="description">` (~150 chars, benefit-led, no keyword stuffing), Open Graph
  (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:type`, `og:url`, `og:site_name`, `og:image`)
  and the full Twitter Card set (`twitter:card = summary_large_image`, title,
  description, image).
- **og:image:** the page's hero (articles) or `assets/sbm-og-card.svg` (default).
  Emitted as an **absolute** URL (`{BASE_URL}/assets/…`) — relative OG images
  don't resolve when the page is shared.
- **Author + identity (added 2026-07-05).** Every article carries
  `<meta name="author" content="Jaco van der Laan">`, `article:author`,
  `article:published_time` (from frontmatter `created`), and a **JSON-LD
  `Article` schema** whose `author` is a `Person` linked via `sameAs` to
  jacovanderlaan.com + LinkedIn + Medium. The hub (`index.html`) carries a
  `WebSite` + `Person` JSON-LD as the **anchor entity**. This is what makes the
  articles show up — and be attributed to Jaco — when someone Googles his name.
  All of it is builder-generated (`build_article_jsonld()` + the `PAGE`
  template); do not hand-add it per file.
- **Canonical URL on every page** (`<link rel="canonical">`, absolute, built from
  `BASE_URL`). This is the **original-home signal** that makes cross-posting to
  Medium safe — without it, a syndicated copy can outrank the source. Required by
  the canonical-first syndication decision (**ADR-062**); see the runbook
  `publish-article-canonical-first.md`.
- **Headings:** exactly one `<h1>` per page (the article/section title); real
  heading hierarchy, no skipped levels — it's read by both crawlers and AI.
- **Alt text on every image** — descriptive and specific (it's accessibility *and*
  SEO *and* what an LLM reads). Captions add context; alt describes the image.
- **Images:** `loading="lazy"` on everything except an above-the-fold hero
  (`loading="eager"`). Keep infographic PNGs reasonably sized.
- **⚠️ AI-image integrity — VERIFY BEFORE PUBLISH (mandatory gate).** Every
  AI-generated infographic must be *looked at* before it ships, because image
  generators routinely produce **garbled/fake text** (misspelled labels, broken
  logos like "Linkedln", nonsense on notebook/laptop screens, mangled diagram
  nodes) — fatal on a site whose whole argument is *structure and quality*.
  Check each image for: (1) fake/garbled/misspelled text in any label, screen,
  logo or prop; (2) **brand colour** — accent must be blue `#2563eb`, payoff gold
  `#b88a1b`; **green is off-brand** and must not be an accent; (3) factual nits
  in rendered data (author names, ratios, place labels); (4) AI artefacts
  (distorted hands/faces, warped UI, style clash with the flat-vector house
  look). If text can't be rendered cleanly, prefer **no text** (blank screens,
  unlabelled spines) over fake text. The 5 Jul 2026 audit
  (`W:/systems/products/sbm/design/image-audit-2026-07-05.md`) is the baseline;
  regenerate flagged images from the brand-colour brief before reuse.
- **Crawlability — welcome bots, don't block them.** This is a public thesis/hub
  site; being found, indexed and *cited* (by search engines **and** AI answer
  engines) is the point, not a threat. `robots.txt` allows all crawlers and
  explicitly welcomes the AI ones (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, CCBot, Google-Extended,
  PerplexityBot, Applebot-Extended). Privacy is controlled by *what we publish*
  (no personal data — see asset hygiene), never by blocking readers. Clean
  human-readable URLs (no query strings). See ADR-060 for the full rationale.
- **Sitemap is generated, not hand-kept.** `build_articles.py` regenerates
  `sitemap.xml` on every build (hub + section pages + articles, with article
  `lastmod`). The canonical base is the `BASE_URL` constant in the builder —
  since the DNS cutover (2026-07-01) it is `https://structurebeatsmagic.com`, and
  the same base feeds every canonical/og:url/JSON-LD URL. `robots.txt`'s
  `Sitemap:` line uses the same host. Override with the `SBM_BASE_URL` env-var
  only for local preview builds.
- **Internal links:** cross-link articles to each other, to `/system`, and the
  enterprise CTA to `jacovanderlaan.com` — a connected site is stronger for both
  readers and ranking. Outbound/affiliate-style links get `rel` as appropriate.
- **⚠️ Link integrity — VERIFY BEFORE PUBLISH (mandatory gate).** Every internal
  link, image `src`, and same-page `#anchor` must resolve. Cross-article links use
  the **published `.html` filename** (e.g. `the-filter-youre-missing-anti-interests.html`),
  NOT a source `.md` path or the old flat filename — those break after the
  folder-per-article migration (this bit `companion_to` links). Run the link-check
  after every build (page links → existing files, `src=` → existing assets,
  `#anchor` → an `id` on the target page). Known false positives to ignore: bare
  `/` (site root, resolves on Pages) and `_cards.html`'s article links (that file is
  a fragment pasted into the homepage, so its hrefs are root-relative). Fix any real
  break in the **source** folder-note, then rebuild — never patch the built HTML.
- **GitHub Pages base path:** templates prefix internal asset/photo URLs with a
  base helper where needed; keep `CNAME` correct for the custom domain.
- **Honesty = durable SEO.** No fabricated numbers, dates, or social proof.

## 7. Deploy

- Static host (GitHub Pages via Actions, or Netlify). No build command for the hub
  itself; `build_articles.py` is run locally before commit.
- Target domain `structurebeatsmagic.com` (DNS cutover at Dynadot — see
  `DOMAIN.md`). Interim: github.io / 301 to jacovanderlaan.com until cutover.
- Private assets (e.g. first-party venue photos in the travel sample) stay
  gitignored — never commit personal photos that aren't meant to publish.

### Asset hygiene — published-only repo (input vs publication)
- **Only assets referenced by the live site belong in `assets/`.** Unused images
  (unreferenced infographics, source photos, ChatGPT outputs you didn't place) do
  **not** live in this public repo.
- **Move, don't delete** unused images to the private staging area:
  `W:/data/products/mdde/output/articles/images/sbm-unused/` (see its README). They
  stay reproducible; the public repo stays clean and free of personal photos.
- Audit before committing: every file in `assets/` should be reachable by a
  `src=`/`url()` in some `.html`/`.css`. Anything else is an orphan — stage it out.
- The line: **publication is public (this repo), input/working is private** (the
  vault for prompts/drafts, the W: workspace for source images).
